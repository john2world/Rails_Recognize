        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>To foster a healthy company culture by promoting daily successes. Previously the company used a private Twitter feed for recognition. They were looking for the next step beyond their homegrown employee-recognition program.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="span6">
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>Goodway chose Recognize above all other Yammer-integrated recognition programs because of its ease of use, flexibility, and easy-to-achieve ROI. It showcases recognition activity and allows sending recognition in the Yammer Stream and Yammer user profiles. To personalize the experience and incentivize corporate behavior, Goodway Group provided specially designed badges representing values in their company. The values can be tracked and promoted through Recognize.</p>
